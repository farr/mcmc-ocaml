This library implements an general MCMC sampler and associated
libraries, including 

* The methods described in Farr and Mandel (2011) for interpolating
  jump proposals in a reversible jump MCMC.

* The evidence calculation methods from Weinberg's paper on Computing
  the Bayesian Factor from a Markov chain Monte Carlo Simulation of
  the Posterior Distribution (http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1777 ).

To build the library, use ocamlbuild:

ocamlbuild mcmc.cma mcmc.cmxa

To build the code documentation:

ocamlbuild mcmc.docdir/index.html

To build the test suite, you will require oUnit
(http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/ ).  Edit the myocamlbuild.ml file
to point to your oUnit installation, and then issue 

ocamlbuild run_tests.{native,byte}
